To run the code, you need to pull the repo, open a terminal, and run “docker-compose build”, and then run “docker-compose up”. To access the front end, you can then go to http://localhost:8501 in a browser. If you want to interact with the API directly, you can go to localhost:8000/docs#.

The Docker images are also published on DockerHub, you can find them here: https://hub.docker.com/repositories/jonathan43.
